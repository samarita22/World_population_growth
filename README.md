# World_population_growth

## Project Overview
In a rapidly growing world full of challenges, it is important to develop tools aimed at tracking the evolution of certain vital indicators. 
The rapid growth of the global population raises significant concerns worldwide, particularly in Africa, where famine and food shortages are hitting hard. 
This project aims to study the evolution of the global population as well as its overall distribution between 2015 and 2023 to assess regions experiencing faster population growth.

-Microsoft Excel
- ETL approach (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- Power Pivot (Data Modeling)
- Pivot Table (Data Summarization)
- DAX Measures (To create Calculated Columns)
- Conditional Formatting (To highlight the key data points )
- Use of graphs to visualize data.

## Some Insights
After this analysis, I was able to observe the following points:
-The TOP 15 countries with a high growth factor in terms of population (between 2015 and 2023) are made up only of African countries (headed by Niger with a growth factor of more than 35% ) 
 Should we be worried about Africa in these times of crisis? ðŸ¤”
In addition, Ukraine finds itself at the bottom of the list with a growth rate of -18.3% (a 18.3% decrease of its population between 2015 and 2023). 
This is undoubtedly due to the armed conflict that this country has been going through for over a year.
